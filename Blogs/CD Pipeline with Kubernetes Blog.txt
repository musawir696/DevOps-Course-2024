This blog provides a concise guide on setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Kubernetes, covering the key steps and tools required for automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications.

Key Concepts in CI/CD
Continuous Integration (CI) involves frequently merging code changes and running automated tests to catch issues early.
Continuous Deployment (CD) deploys tested code to production or staging environments, allowing for continuous delivery of updates.
Architecture & Components
The CI/CD architecture integrates:
Version Control (e.g., Git) for managing code.
CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins or GitLab CI) to handle build and deployment automation.
Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for storing and retrieving container images.
Kubernetes Cluster (e.g., Minikube for local or AKS/EKS for cloud) for scalable application deployment.
Step-by-Step CI/CD Pipeline Setup
Prerequisites: Ensure a Kubernetes cluster, Git repository, Docker, and Jenkins or GitLab CI setup.
Jenkins Installation: Install Jenkins on the Kubernetes cluster using Helm, a Kubernetes package manager. After installation, access Jenkins by retrieving the admin password and port-forwarding.
Configuring the Jenkins Pipeline: Install Docker and Kubernetes plugins in Jenkins, create a new pipeline job, and use a Jenkinsfile with defined stages for building, pushing, and deploying the Docker image to Kubernetes.
Kubernetes Deployment Configuration: Define a deployment YAML file specifying app replicas, image, and port configurations.
Automating Rollouts: Kubernetes supports rolling updates to handle new versions smoothly and commands for rollbacks if needed.
Conclusion
Automating CI/CD with Kubernetes significantly enhances application lifecycle management, ensuring updates are seamlessly deployed and scaled as needed. This setup fosters efficient, continuous delivery, keeping applications up to date with recent changes.
